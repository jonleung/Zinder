# Zinder

The Greek God Zeus is starting an online dating servce called Zinder. Zinder lets any users signup for a potential date with Zeus, and only zeus.

Zinder's Tagline: "Why date anyone else when you can date Zeus?"â„¢.

We have all been hired as Zinder's first employees.


## Setup
Please open `talk.io` to your club's channel


## v0

Time to complete v0 before Zeus smite's all of us: `13 minutes`

### Step 1

Because Zinder is a luxury dating service, anyone who signs up has send in a piece of paper with their desired username and a link to their profile picture.

Zinder's developer teams (that's you) will then manually create Zinder profiles for each user with the following spec:

For example, for the data:

```
username = "jonleung137"
custom_picture = "http://i.imgur.com/eUUrzcj.jpg"
```

The website should look like this:

Hint: To start off, create a file in [c9.io](http://c9.io) that is called `THE_PERSONS_USERNAME.html`

Hint: Make sure the above file ends in `.html`

Hint: Yes, duh, of course you will need to use Google to figure out how to make a webpage with a picture and a title if you don't know already! 

### Step 2

Once you make the simple website in step 1, use Cloud9 to host your website so that it gives you a URL that lets you see the website in your browser and anyone else's browser that is connected to the internet.

A URL may look like this:

`https://twilio-3-jonleung.c9.io/jonleung137.html`

Once you have a URL that you know works, post it in your `tlk.io` channel

Hint: Note this is a bit tricky to Google because Cloud9's documentation isn't too good. Play around in Cloud9 until you think you may find a way to get this. As soon as you find out, let your club leader know!
